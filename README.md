## üöÄ Quick Start

Add the script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/librecap@0.2.3/dist/librecap-min.js"></script>
```

Add a CAPTCHA box to your website by inserting this div wherever you need verification:

```html
<div class="librecap"></div>
```

That's it! The default configuration works out of the box using your own server implementation that can be found [here](https://github.com/librecap/librecap-server).
